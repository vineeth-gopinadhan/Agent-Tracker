# Survey-PF

### Requirements

The fundamental responsibilities of the security agent are to:

1. Track user inputs and
2. Detect when those inputs are used by code that could result in a security exploit.
   For example, child_process.fork(userInput) is a vulnerability waiting to happen.

### Extra

1. Unit tests
2. CI Pipeline in GitHub, to compile, build, test, and report.
